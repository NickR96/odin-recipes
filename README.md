I am currently working on The Odin Project as a way to increase my marketable skills for entering the workforce after I exit the Marine Corps. Up to this point in the program, I have learned a decent amount compared to what I previously knew about the software side of computers. I have learned about linux for the first time, as well as the many different programming languages and tools there are that can be used.
